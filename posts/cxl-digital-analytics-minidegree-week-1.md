If you've spent any time looking at online courses, especially those related to digital marketing and analytics, you'll find tons of courses that are often low quality and don't put in the time to dive deep into a topic. You end up with a surface level understanding of whatever you were trying to learn but lacking the skills needed to actually apply in the real world.

## A Better Option

That's where <a href="http://cxl.com/#_r_billylinder" target="_blank">CXL Institute</a> comes in. They offer advanced courses in a variety of marketing topics, and are recognized as one of the highest-quality sources of training out there. I decided to apply for the <a href="https://cxl.com/institute/scholarship/#_r_billylinder" target="_blank">CXL Scholarship Program</a> and give their <a href="https://cxl.com/institute/certificate/cxl-digital-analytics/#_r_billylinder" target="_blank">Digital Analytics Minidegree</a> a try myself.

For the next 12 weeks, I'll be working my way through this program. I'll provide my honest feedback, both the good and bad, so you can learn more about the programs they offer and find out if it's something you'd find useful on your own career development journey.

## About the Program

The Digital Analytics Minidegree mainly uses Google's suite of analytics tools in the process of teaching you the skills you need to be an expert in the field, while also sprinkling in some other necessities like Excel. The main sections of study include:

1. Google Analytics
2. Presenting Data
3. Google Tag Manager
4. Attribution

With nearly 60 hours of content, the minidegree program covers pretty much all you need to know in order to jump into the field or bring more value to your employer and clients. Plus, all the courses are taught by some of the most well known experts in the industry, so you know you can trust the things you're being taught. All that culminates in a final exam which you'll need to score 90% or higher on in order to pass and earn your certificate. If you Â haven't been able to tell yet, this program is no joke.

## Analytics Fundamentals

To lay a good foundation, the minidegree program begins with a relatively short written course that serves as a great introduction to data analytics for some, or a solid refresher for those that are a bit more familiar or who have done this type of work for a while. Regardless of whether this is brand new information or you've been acquainted with this material for years, it's a great place to start because it gets everyone up to speed quickly and effectively. It can also help clear up some things that you may have thought you knew but actually were either misinformed or under-informed (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>).

This lead-in to the program does an amazing job of getting you familiar with many of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics that are typically used to measure progress towards your business objectives, doing so in a clear and understandable way regardless of background. More importantly, it shows how they fit into the the overall picture.

Business Objectives -> Goals -> KPIs -> Metrics -> knowledge we can act on.

Many people make the mistake of starting with KPIs and metrics, looking to capture as much information as they possibly can without giving any thought to how they apply to the overall business objectives and goals, and certainly no thought toward how it will create actionable knowledge. It great to see that they start out from the beginning establishing those good habits and explaining the right way to do things.

The course also touches on averages and how they can be useless if you're not thinking about things in the right way. Average don't tell you much on their own unless you dive a bit deeper. This might mean segmenting the data or looking at distributions. Whatever you do, an average alone often does little to get you toward the ultimate prize of actionable information.

It concludes with talking about ruling out outliers and statistically insignificant date. This is super important information to understand and internalize. If you don't, it becomes nearly impossible to discover actionable information and all too easy to come to conclusions that lead to incorrect actions.

This is critical information to know. It should all become second nature and part of your natural thought process. Developing these good habits and having the right mindset will help you greatly when doing this work in the workplace where real money is on the line.

## Google Analytics 4

Next, I got started on the <a href="https://cxl.com/institute/course/google-analytics-4/#_r_billy36" target="_blank">Google Analytics 4 (GA4) course</a>, taught by <a href="https://twitter.com/charlesfarina" target="_blank">Charles Farina</a>. For context, I've spent most of my career as an analytics implementation analyst focusing mostly on Adobe Analytics tracking. I have gotten the chance to work some with implementing Google Universal Analytics (UA), but not enough to call myself an expert, and not much with this newest iteration of the platform.

This course did a very good job of explaining things in a way that are approachable for someone regardless of whether they're brand new to Google Analytics or they've been using it for years. Charles does an excellent job of explaining how GA4 differs from UA, what the main improvements are, and what the biggest drawbacks are.

GA4 is still so new that things are still being developed and finalized. This is covered thoroughly in the course, but it still can be confusing at times when trying to follow along in your own GA4 instance because things don't always match up exactly with how things were at the time of recording. This is probably my biggest complaint so far, but this is pretty minor and very understandable considering the fast pace at which this new version is being developed.

Overall, this course got me very excited about GA4, and made me feel very confident with the platform. Obviously there's still a lot to learn, but it made me feel like I could jump in and start implementing and reporting using Google Analytics. It also provided tons of resources, tips, and best practices to follow so you can avoid mistakes later on.

## Wrapping Up

In general, I'm super pleased with the CXL Institute's Digital Analytics Minidegree so far. The lessons have taken the time to dive deeply into the topics and explain things exhaustively so you not only understand how to do something but why it's why. That's an important piece that many learning courses lack.

Week 1 is officially done. Here's to hoping the other 11 keep raising the bar even more!
